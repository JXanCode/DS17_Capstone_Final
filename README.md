# DS17_Capstone_Final

The purpose of this project was to predict the 3-month change in 10-year constant maturity U.S. Treasury yields. The changes are classified into three categories: less than -0.5, between -0.5 and 0.5, or greater than 0.5.

Data was collected from three sources: FRED Database, Office of Financial Research, and Yahoo Finance.

All data files can be found in the ‘data’ folder. The data file used for app deployment is titled ‘Friday_data_1976’. 

All notebooks showing the progression from data collection to the final model can be found in the ‘notebooks’ folder. 

The app is deployed using Streamlit and contains two pages: Explore and Predict. 

‘Explore’ demonstrates the relationship between U.S. Treasury yields and the S&P 500 Index using Plotly visualizations.

‘Predict’ includes the inputs for the model as well as a description of variables.
